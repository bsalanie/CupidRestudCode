\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
We set up the data for the empirical application in our ``Cupid's Invisible Hand'' paper. This data is very similar to that used in Choo and Siow's 2006 {\em Journal of Political Economy\/} article.

This document details the first step of the construction, which turns the CSV files in the \texttt{Input}  subfolder of \texttt{Data}  into the CSV files in the \texttt{Intermediate}  subfolder.

The Python program \verb|make_files_for_estimation.py| manages the second step and produces the text files in the \texttt{Output} subfolder of \texttt{Data}.

\end{abstract}




\section{Working with the  Data}
For each year $Y$=71, 72, we 
downloaded   three  datafiles from the Vital Statistics marriage data center.
\begin{itemize}
\item the main file, \texttt{marrY.csv}, contains the variables
\texttt{year, statemarr,  samplingweight} and  \texttt{husbreform,
  husbforeign,  husbresidstate, husbagemarr, husbrace2, husbeduc} along with the wife variables. It discards all marriages between two foreign partners, where ``foreign'' is everyone who is not in the list of states we use (see online appendix G.3 of our paper, or the variable \texttt{listStates} below).
  \item the files \texttt{husbforeignY.csv} and  \texttt{wifeforeignY.csv} have the same variables; they have marriages with only one ``foreign partner''  (which are also in the corresponding \texttt{marrY.csv} file.) We add these foreign partners to the availables in their residence state. We will deal with the corresponding marriages in \texttt{DataStep2.py}.
\end{itemize}
In addition, we have one file from the ACS 1970: \texttt{IpumsAvailables.csv}. This has variables \textttstatefip, age, sex, agemarr, marrno}, \texttt{race, serial, myperwt, relate}, \texttt{hispan, educd, prevmarr, reform} for each person aged 16-75 who is in a Choo-Siow state and  available for marriage (that is, not married). The weight \texttt{myperwt} is 20 or 50.

First we read them in, convert them to \texttt{R} datafiles, and add the foreigners to the availables. We drop  the race and education variables.
We also recode all state numbers so they refer to the Census codes; the translation stuff is stored in \texttt{listStates.RData}. And we drop marriages in New York City (we do not use New York State anyway.)

In the end we get a file \texttt{ChooSiowAvailables.csv}  that has year of ACS, state, age, sex,  sampling weight, and reform state indicator for every available man or woman in both waves; and a file \texttt{ChooSiowMarriages.csv} that has year of survey, state of marriage, and age/reform for both partners.

\section{Checking the Data}
Now we replicate the numbers in Choo and Siow's Table~2. 
<<doTable2,echo=T>>=
availMenR70 <- 
  sum((CSipums$sex==1 & CSipums$reform==1)*
        CSipums$weight)
availMenN70 <- 
  sum((CSipums$sex==1 &  CSipums$reform==0)*
        CSipums$weight)
availWomenR70 <- 
  sum((CSipums$sex==2 &  CSipums$reform==1)*
        CSipums$weight)
availWomenN70 <- 
  sum((CSipums$sex==2  & CSipums$reform==0)*
        CSipums$weight)

marrRR70 <- 
  sum((marrData$husbreform==1 & marrData$wifereform==1)*
      marrData$samplingweight)
marrRN70 <- 
  sum((marrData$husbreform==1 & marrData$wifereform==0)*
      marrData$samplingweight)
marrNR70 <- 
  sum((marrData$husbreform==0 & marrData$wifereform==1)*
      marrData$samplingweight)
marrNN70 <- 
  sum((marrData$husbreform==0 & marrData$wifereform==0)*
      marrData$samplingweight)

@
We have \Sexpr{availMenR70} men available in 1970 in reform states, and \Sexpr{availMenN70} in non-reform  states. For women the numbers are  \Sexpr{availWomenR70}
and \Sexpr{availWomenN70}.

Choo and Siow impute one marriage in each cell where there is none, which we did not do here. Our  numbers of marriages RR were \Sexpr{marrRR70} in 1971--72; for NN they 
were \Sexpr{marrNN70}.

These numbers are very close to Choo and Siow's.

\section{Creating the Intermediate Files}

Finally, we convert the data to CSV format.

<<convertCsv,echo=T>>=
write.csv(CSipums, paste(outputs_dir, "ChooSiowAvailables.csv", sep=''), 
          row.names=F)
write.csv(marrData, paste(outputs_dir, "ChooSiowMarriages.csv", sep=''), 
          row.names=F)
